This is a 3D printable fan shroud for the ProMega using the original front and part fans.
It can also accommodate a Noctua 40x40x12 fan.

Please note, to install this fan shroud, you have to turn your heat block by 90 degrees with the wires coming out the back.  Please refer to the photos on how the cables should be routed.

The cable for the part fan needs to be removed from the front cable assembly.  You then have to pull a bit more of the cable through the cable chain (there is plenty of slack at the board end).  Refer to the photos on how the part fan cable should be routed and how the plug fits into the fan shroud.

This was modeled in Fusion 360 and I included the Fusion 360 archive file in the CAD folder together with just about any other format Fusion 360 can export.  The STL is in the folder STL (shocking).  The Simplify3D folder has a factory file in it.  The speed is set to 20mm/s, please adjust to what ever your printer is capable of printing.
The GCode folder has two files in it.  One is using Tool 0, the other one is modified to use the mixing tool with a linear gradient between the right and the left extruder.
